\uebung{Getting to Know the \textcolor{myblue}{Qubit}.}

In this exercise, you will be asked to do some work.


\begin{exenumerate}
\item Stare at this equation for at least half an hour.
  \begin{align}
    A = B.
  \end{align}

\item Solve it.
  \hint{You might need to specify the unknown.}

  \begin{loesung}
    The solution is given by ...... 
    \begin{align}
      A=B\ ,
    \end{align}
    of course.

    [Note that the equation in the solution has a separate numbering !]
  \end{loesung}
\end{exenumerate}

There's a second part to this exercise (horrayy!)
\begin{align}
  \text{another equation} = \text{more fun}\ .
\end{align}

\exenumfulllabel{expart:ThisIsALabelOutsideExenumEnvironment}

\begin{exenumerate} % {exenumerate} environment automatically resumes correct numbering!
\item \exenumfulllabel{expart:FullDoNothing}
  Please do:
  \begin{exenumerate}
  \item \label{expart:Sleep}
    Now go to bed and sleep for at least 8 hours.
  \item \exenumfulllabel{expart:FullSleep}
    Do nothing else.
  \item Do nothing more.
  \end{exenumerate}

\item Convince your professor that you did some great work during last night when you did
  point~\ref{expart:Sleep} and point~\ref{expart:FullSleep}, in
  point~\ref{expart:FullDoNothing}.

\item Write a summary on density operators.
  \pdfloesung{fig/Summary_DensityOperator.pdf}

\end{exenumerate}

This text: `\ref{expart:ThisIsALabelOutsideExenumEnvironment}' should be empty.

\begin{loesung}
  % note that {exenumerate} is reset inside a {loesung} env that is not itself inside an
  % {exenumerate}!
  \begin{exenumerate}
  \item This part is easy.
    \begin{align}
      A \neq B
    \end{align}
  \item This one not.
  \end{exenumerate}
\end{loesung}


\subexercise{\LaTeX{} package.}

\begin{exenumerate}
\item Also, write a small manual on how to use the \texttt{ethuebung} package.
\end{exenumerate}

Hi there! Note that this text is on the same line as the exercise title because we have
not left a newline between the \texttt{\textbackslash subuebung} command and the question
text.
